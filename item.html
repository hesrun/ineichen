                        When it comes to watch design as art, Gérald Genta is by far the first to be mentioned. Some call him the Picasso of watch design, which underlines his status, but isn’t relevant in terms of style. His influence, his touch on this design is obvious to me. Gérald Genta can be concise, as with the Royal Oak, the Nautilus, or the Seamaster Titanium, but he can also be overly baroque. This lot convincingly demonstrates this facet of his talent, even though the watch was produced when the master had already left the brand he founded. Interest in this lot is also heightened by its incredible rarity. Among the unique specimens, as most models of the Grande Sonnerie series were produced, there are only a few that are equipped with a manual winding caliber.

                        Lot essay&nbsp; </h3>
                    <p>
                        Reference 3737 is one of the <b>most intriguing and rare</b> references in modern Breguet
                        history. It was released in the wake of the Ref. 3430 wristwatch of the historical Souscription
                        set released in 1991, which, in addition to a wristwatch, included the Ref. 1819 pocket watch.
                        As announced by the brand, the <b>Souscription set</b> was produced in a limited edition of 300
                        sets in gold or platinum. It was an ambitious release with the highly sophisticated Ref. 3430,
                        featuring <b>traditional minute repeater and perpetual calendar </b>complications, and an
                        extravagant self-winding pocket watch. At that time, only a few leading brands produced watches
                        of such a level of complexity as Ref. 3430.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Antiquorum estimates the circulation of the present reference to be only 5 examples.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ref. 3737 was released as a <b>modification of the reference 3430</b> from the Souscription set,
                        albeit in much smaller numbers. Antiquorum estimates the circulation of the present reference to
                        be only 5 examples. The extremely small production of Ref. 3737 is indirectly supported by the
                        fact that, to our knowledge, this reference has <b>only come up at auction once</b>, at
                        Antiquorum in Geneva in 1999. We estimate that this model was produced approximately from 1994
                        to 1996.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Technically, it is almost the same model as the wristwatch <b>presented in the Souscription
                            set.</b> Ref. 3430 from the Souscription set features a combined month and leap year
                        single-hand indicator for a 48-month cycle at 12 o’clock, while the present model has two hands
                        in a sub-dial at 12 o’clock – one for the 12-month indicator, and one for the leap year
                        indicator. Both references are powered by the same <b>hand-wound minute-repeater caliber
                            567</b>, produced for the brand by the <b>Nouvelle Lémania</b> movement-blanks factory.
                        Evidently, it was developed <b>on the basis of classic pocket watch </b>calibers from the
                        Vallée-de-Joux, in a characteristic design with three straight bridges. It is the so-called
                        ‘three-finger’ wheel-train bridge caliber.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        The sophistication and rarity of the mechanical functions of the minute repeater and perpetual
                        calendar is complemented in this example by the classic artisanal Breguet guilloché dial, as
                        well as the traditional finishing of the caliber
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The finish of caliber 567 is <b>upscale traditional,</b> with Côte de Genève on the bridges,
                        perlage on the mainplate, chamfered and polished bevels, extremely difficult to finish sharp
                        inner and outer corners, engraved and gilded inscriptions, and flat polished steel parts –
                        including two <b>black-polished repeater hammers.</b> The flat spring ratchet of the barrel
                        wheel should also be noted, something found extremely rarely in modern wristwatches and
                        extremely highly appreciated by connoisseurs. The dial of the present example is of typical
                        Breguet style. The <b>silver-plated solid gold dial</b> is decorated with guilloché of three
                        motifs. The chapter ring and sub-dials’ rims are circularly brushed, with black pad-printed
                        scales, inscriptions and Roman numerals complemented by <b>blued steel ‘pomme de Breguet’</b>
                        and counters’ hands. The <b>yellow gold Empire style case</b> completes the picture, creating a
                        coherent image of Breguet’s high-end, super-complex wristwatch.&nbsp;
                    </p>

                        Reasons to bid&nbsp; </h3>
                    <p>
                        According to our knowledge only one example of this <b>highly complicated minute repeating</b>
                        wristwatch has appeared at auction, so the present lot affords collectors the opportunity to
                        acquire <b>one of the rarest wristwatches</b>, embedded with classic high complications of
                        Breguet’s modern production. The Répétition Minutes Quantième Perpétuel Ref. 3737BA is an
                        <b>extremely rare, charismatic and exquisite </b>watch from a world-famous traditional watch
                        brand, one of the undoubted leaders in the haute horlogerie watch market. The sophistication and
                        rarity of the mechanical functions of the minute repeater, the <b>highest of the four
                            traditional complications,</b> and perpetual calendar, combining mechanical sophistication
                        with a practical use, is complemented in this example by the classic artisanal Breguet guilloché
                        dial, as well as the traditional finishing of the caliber, which significantly increase the
                        perceived value of the watch and underscore the aesthetic character of this model, endowed with
                        the finest signs of the <b>famous Breguet style.&nbsp;</b>

                <h4>Why we use Swiss Freeports</h4>
                <p>Freeports are privately run warehouses, in which goods can be stored without triggering the payment of customs duty and VAT.</p>
                <p>VAT and customs duty are only payable at the destination country when the goods leave the freeport.</p>
                <p>On top of that, freeports offer a high degree of security and privacy.</p>
                <p>Switzerland has a long tradition in customs warehouses, going back as far as 1888 when the Geneva Freeport was founded.</p>
                <p>Freeports, or duty-free warehouses, are part of the Swiss customs territory and are supervised by the Swiss Customs Administration.</p>

                <h2>HOW TO BID ONLINE</h2>
                <p><b>Browse an auction</b> on Ineichen.com or on the Ineichen’s app to find an item you’re most
                    interested in. If you’re new to the world of online auctions, just contact us, and with guidance of
                    our specialists, you can navigate this exciting world with ease. All items in the auction are
                    available for viewing by appointment.</p>
                <p><b>Place a bid</b> through Ineichen.com or on the Ineichen’s app when the auction starts, until the
                    lot closes. With live video streaming, bidding is a unique and dynamic experience you’ll love being
                    part of – please contact our specialists should you need any assistance. See below for detailed
                    instructions on how to bid in online and live auctions.</p>
                <p><b>Keep constant watch</b> over the lots you’re interested in. If you are outbid in an auction, you
                    will be notified on the auction catalogue page by email, and by push notifications, which allows you
                    to react immediately to any higher bids. </p>
                <p><b>The final step</b> – and the most fun part. After your lot has closed, you’ll be notified via
                    email and lot details page. If you’re the highest bidder, shortly after the auction you’ll receive
                    an invoice with a list of your total charges and instructions on how to collect the item(s) that you
                    won.</p>
                <h2>ONLINE ONLY AUCTIONS</h2>
                <h5>Go to lot page</h5>
                <p>You can bid online in real time at any Ineichen auction around the world. To bid online, you need to
                    log in or create a new account. Before placing your first bid, you’ll be asked to accept the Terms &
                    Conditions and choose your account number.</p>
                <h5>Place your bid</h5>
                <p>Select the desired lot and place your maximum bid. The system will place incremental bids on your
                    behalf up to the maximum amount specified. Click the ‘Quick Bid’ button to increase your bid to the
                    next increment. A countdown will appear at the top of the auction page indicating the time remaining
                    before bidding closes on the lot.</p>
                <p>Each lot closes in one minute increments and as it begins to close, you’ll notice a countdown timer
                    next to this lot. If you place a bid within the final minute before the lot’s scheduled closing
                    time, the bidding will be extended by two minutes. </p>
                <h2>LIVE AUCTIONS</h2>
                <p>You can bid in real time against other bidders by telephone, online, in the room, or by absentee
                    bidding. To participate in a live auction, you need to register your details first, either in person
                    at the auction house, or by phone or online by clicking the relevant link on the auction overview
                    page.</p>
                <p>The most convenient way to bid at an auction is to place a maximum bid. Just enter the maximum amount
                    you’re willing to pay for the lot, and Ineichen.com will take care of the bidding from there.
                    Absentee bids, which enable you to set your maximum bid on a lot, are executed on your behalf by the
                    auctioneer ahead of the auction, in a similar way as traditional absentee bids.</p>
                <p>After you have registered for the auction, you’re ready to bid live. Log into your account on
                    Ineichen.com first and at the started date and time you’ll be able to see and hear the auction
                    taking place via live video feed from the auction room. You’ll be able to participate by bidding in
                    the saleroom, by phone, or online via Ineichen.com or the Ineichen app. </p>
                <p>A live auction begins as the auctioneer opens each lot for bidding. Each lot being sold is shown on
                    the screen together with level of bidding displayed beside it. When the lot you want to bid on is
                    coming up, start bidding. We accept the bids in the order we receive them, and the highest bid
                    placed wins each lot. So even if you placed the leading maximum bid before the auction, please note
                    that another client can outbid you during the live auction.</p>
                <h2>AUCTION GLOSSARY</h2>
                <h5>Absentee Bid </h5>
                <p>If you’re not able to participate in an auction yourself, you can still bid on an item by placing an
                    absentee bid with the auctioneer before an auction begins. During the live auction the auctioneer
                    will execute your absentee bid on your behalf and if there are clients who would like to increase,
                    the auctioneer is going to keep adding bids until they reach the limit you have set. You win the
                    item if the auction ends under your amount, but if other clients outbid you, you have lost the
                    auction. We will notify the successful absentee bidders after the auction.</p>
                <h5>Maximum Bid</h5>
                <p>Instead of incrementally bid in a live auction, you can use the maximum bid feature, which represents
                    the absolute highest price you are willing to pay for a lot. Ineichen will execute bids on your
                    behalf by placing the lowest bid necessary and never going higher than your maximum bid. </p>
                <p>Our bidding platform will automatically execute incremental bids on your behalf beginning at the
                    lowest increment, without going higher than your maximum bid. If you get outbid by another client
                    you’ll be notified via email or push notifications so you could increase your bid. </p>
                <p>If two different bidders enter the same maximum bid, we will prioritize the bid which was entered
                    first.</p>
                <p>If you wish to place an absentee bid, the auctioneer will execute your maximum bid on your behalf and
                    if your bid wins, you’ll be notified after the auction. You are free to increase your maximum before
                    the live auction starts.</p>
                <h5>Starting Bid</h5>
                <p>Also know known as “opening bid”, it represents the lowest possible price you may place on a lot, and
                    it’s the price at which the bidding starts. Clients are allowed to bid at or above the starting bid.
                    Also, you can place a bid which is lower than the reserve price, but the item can be sold only when
                    you meet or exceed the reserve price. We will notify you if you become a leading bidder or if you
                    have been outbid. </p>
                <h5>Quick Bid</h5>
                <p>Quick Bid feature allows you to increase your bid to the next increment in a fraction of a second.
                    Just click the “Quick Bid” to confirm your bid increase on Ineichen.com, and your bid will be
                    placed. This feature is available in online only auctions. </p>
                <h5>My Active Bids</h5>
                <p>In this section you can browse all your current bids and their status: active, won and lost bids
                    marked with corresponding colors. </p>
